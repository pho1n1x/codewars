# Description
In JavaScript, `Number` is one of basic data types. It can be positive: `1, 2, 3`, negative: `-1, -100`, integer: `123, 456`, decimal: `3.1415926, -8.88` etc ...

Numbers can use operators such as `+ - * / %`

# Task
I've written five functions `equal1`, `equal2`, `equal3`, `equal4` and `equal5`, and defined six global variables `v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6`. Every function has two local variables `a, b`, please set the appropriate values for the two variables (select from `v1` - `v6`), making these functions return values equal to 100. The function `equal1` is completed, please refer to this example to complete the following functions.
