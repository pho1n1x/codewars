Name: [Enumerable Magic #1 - True for All?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/enumerable-magic-number-1-true-for-all)

Difficulty: **8 Kyu**

# Description
Create a method `all?` which takes an array, and a block and returns `true` if the block returns `true` for every element in the array. Otherwise, it should return `false`. If the array is empty, it should return `true`, since technically nothing failed the block test.

# Scenario
```ruby
def all? array, &block

end
```
