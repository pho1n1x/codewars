Name: [Name on billboard](https://www.codewars.com/kata/name-on-billboard)

Difficulty: **8 Kyu**

# Description
You can print your name on a billboard ad. Find out how much it will cost you. Each letter has a default price of £30, but that can be different if you are given 2 parameters instead of 1.

You can not use multiplier `*` operator.


# Example
If your name would be *Jeong-Ho Aristotelis*, ad would cost **£600**. 20 letters * 30 = 600 (Space counts as a letter).

# Scenario

def billboard(name, price)
