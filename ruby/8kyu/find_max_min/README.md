Name: [Find Maximum and Minimum Values of a List](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-maximum-and-minimum-values-of-a-list)

Difficulty: **8 Kyu**

# Description
Your task is to make two functions, `max` and `min` that take an array of integers list as input and outputs, respectively, the largest and lowest number in that array.

# Example
```ruby
max([4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]) returns 566
min([-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110]) returns -110
max([5]) returns 5
min([42, 54, 65, 87, 0]) returns 0
```

# Notes
* You may consider that there will not be any empty arrays.

# Scenario
```ruby
def min(list)
  
end

def max(list)
  
end
```
