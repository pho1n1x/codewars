Name: [Convert a String to a Number!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/convert-a-string-to-a-number)

Difficulty: **8 Kyu**

# Description
We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

## Note
Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

# Example
```ruby
tring_to_number "1234"  == 1234
string_to_number "605"   == 605
string_to_number "1405"  == 1405
string_to_number "-7"    == -7
```

# Scenario
```ruby
def string_to_number(s)
  # ... your code here
end
```
