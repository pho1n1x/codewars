# Description
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers `(1 <= n <= 100)` and the square of their sum. For example, when `n = 10`:

```ruby
1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385
```

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

```ruby
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025
```

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

# Example
```ruby
difference_of_squares(10)
# => 2640
```
