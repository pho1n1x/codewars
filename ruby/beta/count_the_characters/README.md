# Kata
Name: [Count the Characters](https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-the-characters)

Difficulty: **Beta**

# Description
The goal of this kata is to write a function that takes two inputs: a `string` and a `character`. The function will count the number of times that character appears in the string. The count is case insensitive.

The character can be any alphanumeric character.

# Example
```ruby
count_char("fizzbuzz","z") => 4
count_char("Fancy fifth fly aloof","f") => 5
```
