Difficulty: **6 Kyu**

# Description
I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.

I would like for you to write me a function that when given a number `n` returns the `n-th` number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

# Examples
```ruby
nth_fibonacci(4) #=> 2
```

Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

# Scenario
```ruby
def nth_fibonacci(n) 
  # Return the n-th number in the Fibonacci Sequence
end
```
