Difficulty: **7 Kyu**

# Description
Write a function which reduces fractions to their simplest form! Fractions will be presented as an array, and the reduced fraction must be returned as an array:

```ruby
input: [numerator, denominator]   output: [newNumerator, newDenominator]
                    Eg: [45, 120] --> [3, 8]
```

All numerators and denominators will be positive integers.

# Scenario
```ruby
def reduce(fraction)
    # your code here
    return [n1, d1] # a proper fraction
```
