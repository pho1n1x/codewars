# Kata
Name: [Re-open class](https://www.codewars.com/kata/re-open-class)

Difficulty: **7 Kyu**

# Description
Ruby lets you re-open classes so you can add new functionality to existing classes and objects. In this kata, you'll have to add a new method in the `String` class that calls the `upcase` method, so that:

```ruby
"abc".my_new_method
```

returns:

```ruby
"ABC"
```
