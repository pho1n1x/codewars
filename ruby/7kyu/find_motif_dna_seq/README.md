# Kata
Name: [Find the motif in DNA sequence](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-motif-in-dna-sequence)

Difficulty: **7 Kyu**

# Description
In genetics, a sequenceâ€™s motif is a nucleotides (or amino-acid) sequence pattern. Sequence motifs have a biological significance. For more information you can take a look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_motif).

For this kata you need to complete the function `motif_locator`. This function receives 2 arguments - a sequence and a motif. Both arguments are strings.

You should return an array that contains all the start positions of the motif (in order). A sequence may contain 0 or more repetitions of the given motif. Note that the number of the first position is 1, not 0.

# Examples
* For the sequence `"ACGTGGGGACTAGGGG"` and the motif `"GGGG"` the result should be `[5, 13]`.
* For the sequence `"ACCGTACCAAGGGACC"` and the motif `"AAT"` the result should be `[]`.
* For the sequence `"GGG"` and the motif `"GG"` the result should be `[1, 2]`.

# Scenario
```ruby
def motif_locator(sequence, motif)

end
```
