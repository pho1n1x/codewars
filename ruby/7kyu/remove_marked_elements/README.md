Name: [Remove All The Marked Elements of a List](https://www.codewars.com/kata/remove-all-the-marked-elements-of-a-list)

Difficulty: **7 Kyu**

# Description
We need a method in the `Class List` that may remove from a given list of integers, all the values contained in a second list. The method `remove_()` will accept two arguments, a list of an uncertain amount of integers, `integer`_list and a second list that contains integer values, too, `values_list`. The method will output a list with all the integers that are not in `values_list`.

# Scenario
```ruby
class Array
  def remove_(integer_list, values_list)
    #your code here
  end
end
```
