# Kata
Name: [Reverse complement (DNA )](https://www.codewars.com/kata/reverse-complement-dna)

Difficulty: **7 Kyu**

# Description
In genetic the reverse complement of a sequence is formed by **reversing** the sequence and then taking the complement of each symbol.

The four nucleotides in DNA is Adenine (*A*), Cytosine (*C*), Guanine (*G*) and Thymine (*T*).

* A is the complement of T
* C is the complement of G.

This is a bi-directional relation so:

* T is the complement of A
* G is the complement of C.

For this kata you need to complete the reverse complement function that take a DNA string and return the reverse complement string.

Note: You need to take care of lower and upper case. And if a sequence conatains some invalid characters you need to return "Invalid sequence".

# Scenario
```ruby
def reverse_complement(dna)

end
```
