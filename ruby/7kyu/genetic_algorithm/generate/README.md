# Kata
Name: [Genetic Algorithm Series - #1 Generate](https://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-1-generate)

Difficulty: **7 Kyu**

# Description
A **genetic algorithm** is based in groups of chromosomes, called populations. To start our population of chromosomes we need to generate random binary strings with a specified length.

In this kata you have to implement a function `generate` that receives a `length` and has to return a random binary string with `length` characters.

# Example
Generate a chromosome with length of 4 `generate(4)` could return the chromosome `0010`, `1110`, `1111`, ... or any of `2^4` possibilities.

# Scenario
```ruby
def generate(length)
  # Good Luck!
end
```
