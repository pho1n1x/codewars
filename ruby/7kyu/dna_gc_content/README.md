Name: [DNA GC-content](https://www.codewars.com/kata/dna-gc-content)

Difficulty: **7 Kyu**

# Description
The four bases found in DNA are adenine (*A*), cytosine (*C*), guanine (*G*) and thymine (*T*).

In genetics, *GC-content* is the percentage of Guanine and Cytosine bases on a DNA molecule that are either guanine or cytosine.

Given a DNA sequence (a `string`) return the GC-content in percent, rounded up to 2 decimal digits for Python, not rounded in all other languages.

For more information about GC-content you can take a look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC-content).

# Example
```ruby
The GC-content of the following DNA sequence is 50%: "AAATTTCCCGGG".
```

# Scenario
```ruby
def gc_content(dna)

end
```
